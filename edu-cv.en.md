## Summary

**Software Engineer** with more than **10 years experience**. In the course of my career I´ve been in touch with many programming languages like C#, Python or Java even I have focused in **PHP** and **JavaScript**.

I have a great experience in web development and complex architectures; I like to build smart and efficient software, easy to read and that provides added value to its users.

I have been involved in several successful projects like a programmer, **project manager** or **team leader**, taking an active part in design, tests and development.

My interest in **agile development** techniques is increasing every day and I am a Certified Scrum Master. I also spend part of my free time programming and with a continuous training.

I consider myself a curious, responsible person and a team player who is ready to overcome any challenge.

I have a GNU / Linux background even I use Mac OS at home. I like to do some sysadmin tasks because I really believe that knowing the stack where someone works gives you interesting advantages when you have to provide solutions.
